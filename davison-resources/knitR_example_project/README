This analysis is performed using the R package kitr, which enables reproducible reports to be made using a combination of LaTeX and R.  knitr supercedes Sweave and is a very useful tool if you already use R and LaTeX.  If not, why not?

It may be efficient for you to write your report by saving the file "CO2.Rnw" as "MyProjectName.Rnw", editing it, and using knitr. You can compile the document directly from RStudio using pdflatex. If you are transitioning from Sweave to knitR, use Sweave2knitr  

The files in this directory are:

1) README: this file

2)  http://yihui.name/knitr/: what it says.  See also

http://kbroman.org/knitr_knutshell/

3) CO2.Rnw: Sweave file to make computations in R, and to incorporate them into a LaTeX file, thus giving the data analysis and write-up in a single file.  

4) CO2.R: R code to run analyses in CO2.Rnw, produced using purl("CO2.Rnw")

6) ACD.bib: bibliography file with BibTeX records needed for write-up, plus many more

7) CUP.bst: bibliography style file

9) There are also lots of other files starting with C02, which are generated by the script.  Do not edit these, as they will be overwritten each time the script is run.
