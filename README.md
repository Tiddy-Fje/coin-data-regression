## README for Coin-Data Regression Analysis

### Project Overview
This project was developed as part of the Regression Methods course at EPFL. It builds on the 2024 IgNobel Prize-winning paper on coin-flipping probabilities by using regression methods to analyze its associated large dataset of coin flips.

See `report.pdf` for a detailed analysis and discussion of the project. It covers a recap of our exploratory data analysis, model comparisons, and findings related to learning and memory effects. It also includes insights into GLM and WLS model comparisons.


### How to Run the Analysis
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```
2. Set up the environment using the provided `environment.yml` file:
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate regression
   ```
3. Open and run the Jupyter notebooks.
